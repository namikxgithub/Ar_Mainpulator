After installing all the packages go to the workspace and do `catkin_make` again and you are good to go!

## Run the project

All set! now we can proceed with the excution part...    
- First launch the UR5_AR app in your android device or enter the playmode if you are using the unity editor.
- After that launch the `ar_test` launch file in the `ebot_description` package. This can be launched by the following command.
```bash
roslaunch ebot_mani ar_test.launch
```
>This will launch the UR5 arm in Rviz and Gazebo
>A TCP Server will start on the ROS running device to communicate with the AR app. 
>The joint angles are published on the `SourceDestination` topic which are subscribed by the `arm_joint_angle.py`script in the ebot_mani package to move the arm accordingly in gazebo using moveit!

Alright! Now you can fiddle around with the joint angles in the AR app and hit publish and you will see that the Arm moves in gazbo like you set in the APP
**Have Fun!**
